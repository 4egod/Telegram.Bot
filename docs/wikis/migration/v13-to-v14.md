# Migrate from v13 to v14

## `GetUpdatesAsync()`, `SetWebhookAsync()`

Value `All` is removed from enum `Telegram.Bot.Types.Enums.UpdateType`. In order to get all kind of updates, pass an empty list such as `Enumerable.Empty<UpdateType>()` for `allowedUpdates` argument.

## `SetWebhookAsync()`

Parameter `url` is required. If you intend to remove the webhook, it's recommented to use `DeleteWebhookAsync()` instead. However, you could achieve the same result by passing `string.Empty` value to `url` argument.
